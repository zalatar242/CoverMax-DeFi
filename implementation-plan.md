# Implementation Plan: DeFi Multi-Platform Protocol

## 1. Core Interface Design

### ILendingAdapter.sol

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
interface ILendingAdapter {
    /// @notice Deposits assets into the lending platform
    /// @param asset The address of the asset to deposit (USDC)
    /// @param amount The amount to deposit
    /// @return The amount of shares/tokens received
    function deposit(address asset, uint256 amount) external returns (uint256);

    /// @notice Withdraws assets from the lending platform
    /// @param asset The address of the asset to withdraw (USDC)
    /// @param amount The amount to withdraw
    /// @return The amount actually withdrawn
    function withdraw(address asset, uint256 amount) external returns (uint256);

    /// @notice Gets the current balance of deposited assets
    /// @param asset The address of the asset to check
    /// @return The current balance
    function getBalance(address asset) external view returns (uint256);

    /// @notice Handles errors that may occur during deposit or withdraw
    /// @param asset The address of the asset
    /// @param amount The amount to deposit or withdraw
    /// @param errorCode A code representing the error that occurred
    function handleLendingError(address asset, uint256 amount, uint256 errorCode) external;
}
```

## 2. Three-Tranche System

### Tranche Token Contracts

- Modify existing Tranche.sol to support three levels (A, B, C)
- Each tranche gets a fixed equal allocation (33.33%)
- Simple ERC20 tokens representing shares in the protocol

## 3. USDC Integration

-   Replace all instances of DAI with USDC throughout the contracts.
-   Update the `deposit` and `withdraw` functions to use USDC.
-   Ensure that the contract interacts correctly with the USDC contract.

## 4. Implementation Sequence

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

1.  Create ILendingAdapter interface
2.  Modify Tranche contract for three tranches with fixed allocation
3.  Create base InsuranceCore contract
4.  Add USDC integration

### Phase 2: Platform Integration

1.  Implement AaveAdapter (Targeting Aave v3)
2.  Implement MoonwellAdapter (Targeting Moonwell on Moonbeam)
3.  Implement FluidAdapter (Targeting Fluid Protocol)

### Phase 3: Testing

1.  Unit tests for each component
2.  Integration tests for platform interactions
3.  Basic operation tests
4.  Error handling tests

## 5. Key Considerations

### Gas Optimization

-   Batch operations where possible
-   Optimize storage usage
-   Use efficient data structures

### Security Measures

-   Basic access control for admin functions
-   Implement circuit breakers for emergency withdrawals

### Error Handling

-   Implement error handling in the lending adapters to manage failures when interacting with external platforms.
-   Use `handleLendingError` to revert transactions if needed.

## 6. Dependencies

### External Contracts

-   OpenZeppelin for base contracts
-   Aave v3 contracts
-   Moonwell contracts
-   Fluid Protocol contracts
-   USDC contract

### Development Tools

-   Hardhat for development/testing
-   Ethers.js for testing
-   Solidity 0.8.28+

This plan focuses on basic functionality with three equal tranches and fixed platform integrations.
